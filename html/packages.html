                  <p style="color: black; padding: 1rem;">One of world's most spectacular tropical island systems, Lakshadweep is tucked away at 220-440Kms off the Kerala Coast. The islands offer a precious heritage of ecology and culture. The unique feature of the Islands is its coral reef, making it a pristine leisure spot to come back to. 4200 sq. kms. of lagoon, rich in marine wealth, is spread over 36 islands in an area of 32 sq. kms. 
                   <br> The underwater view at Lakshadweep is kaleidoscopic and breathtaking. The lagoon offers excellent potential for water sports like swimming, wind-surfing, diving, snorkeling and kayaking. No wonder, Lakshadweep is fast becoming India's one of its kind Adventure sport - Nature Tourism location. Each island is fringed by snow white coral sands. The crystal clear water and the abundant marine life enhance the beauty of these islands. 
                   <br> Against the vast expanse of the blue sea, the island look like emeralds. The huge shallow calm lagoon on one side with wall like reef made of marine live coral boulders blocks the incoming swells of the outer sea. The islands are linked to the mainland by: - ship, helicopter, Indian Airlines, Kingfisher Airlines and mechanized sailing wooden vessels. In all the islands, elaborate infrastructure is in place to meet the needs of tourists.</p>
