                    Lakshadweep has a largely uncharted surf-spot potential. It offers a
                    knowledgeable surf explorer quite a handful of interesting options. The prime
                    season for surfing in the Arabian Sea is between April and September as the
                    other months usually offer cleaner conditions, that is lesser wind. <br> Surfing in the
                    pristine blue-water barrels in this exotic location is a must have on your to do
                    list during your visit to these mesmerizing islands. The locals don’t surf in
                    Lakshadweep yet so you will have a curious audience watching from the pier.
                    As there are no surf shops in Lakshadweep, it is best to bring your surf
                    equipment with you. <br>Information on all the <em style="text-decoration: underline;"> necessary equipment needed to
                    surf</em> can be found <a style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.ripcurl.com/us/blog/surfing-for-beginners.html"> here</a>. Lakshadweep is blessed with some of the world’s best reef breaks. Who

It is believed that a violent storm in 1847 threw up huge coral boulders along these shores. It is a socially progressive island and it was here that girls first went to school when women's education was considered taboo. One can swim, snorkel or reef-walk in the vast lagoon and indulge in water sports on kayaks, sailboats and pedal boats. Two bathing huts with change rooms are available at Koomel Beach. Visit to Kalpeni is part of Coral Reef package.
